# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Henrik and I'm a software developer.
I have a passion for making software and currently focused on learning how to make beautiful and easy-to-use iOS apps.
When I have time for it I also enjoy contributing to open source software.

- Swift
- Go

... and of course the good old ones: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
